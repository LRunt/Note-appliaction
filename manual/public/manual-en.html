        <h2>Launching the App</h2>
        <p>When the app is launched, an initialization screen with the app's logo appears. This screen indicates that the app is initializing.</p>
        <img src="img/splash_screen.jpg" alt="Initialization Screen" style="max-width: 300px;">

        <p>The following section describes the different settings options</p>
        <h3>Language</h3>
        <p>The language option in the settings changes the app's localization. In the current version, two languages are available: Czech and English.</p>
        <h3>Dark Mode</h3>
        <p>This option switches the app's appearance mode. The app has a light and a dark mode that can be toggled with this switch in the settings.</p>
        <h3>Show Conflicts</h3>
        <p>If a conflict is detected, the local version of the conflicting data is saved. This data can be displayed with the show button next to the <i>Show Conflicts</i> option.
            The appearance of the conflict page is shown in the next image.
        </p>
        <img src="img/conflicts.jpg" alt="Conflicting Data" style="max-width: 300px;">
        <p>This page displays all conflicts. Each conflict is named after the file and the timestamp when the conflict occurred.
            Users can view and delete this data.
        </p>
        <h3>Delete Local App Data</h3>
        <p>This option deletes all app data. After pressing it, a dialog will appear to confirm if the user wants to delete all this data. The data is then deleted, and the app returns to its first-open state.
            This feature was primarily for testing purposes, but it remains for users who want to restore the app to its first-open state.
        </p>
        <h3>App Information</h3>
        <p>Displays a dialog box with information about the app, such as the author, app version, and release date.</p>
